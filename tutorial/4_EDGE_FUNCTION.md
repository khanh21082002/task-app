Okay, I need to convert the given callback-based code to use async/await. Let me look at the code provided.

First, I notice that the function is already declared as async, which is good. The code uses await for several operations like request.json(), supabase inserts, and OpenAI API calls. That means most of the code is already using async/await correctly.

I should check if there are any callback-style operations left. For example, functions like .then() or .catch() might indicate callbacks. In the provided code, I don't see any .then() or .catch() usage. Everything is using await, which is the async/await pattern.

Looking at error handling, the code uses try-catch blocks, which is appropriate for async/await. Each potential error point is wrapped in a try block, and errors are caught and handled gracefully.

I also check the Supabase and OpenAI client calls. Both are using await, so they're already using promises correctly. The Supabase insert and update operations are awaited, and the OpenAI API call is also awaited.

I don't see any need for converting callbacks to promises here because everything is already promise-based. The function is structured correctly with async/await, so no further conversion is necessary.

Therefore, the code is already in the desired async/await format, and no changes are needed.

The provided code is already using async/await syntax. There are no callback-style operations that need to be converted.
