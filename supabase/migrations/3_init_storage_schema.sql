Okay, I need to help the user convert their callback-based code to use async/await. Let me look at the code they provided.

First, I see that the user has several async functions like runSetup, deleteExistingBucket, createStorageBucket, etc. Each of these functions uses await with db.query, which is good because it's already using Promises.

The main function, runSetup, is an async function that awaits each of these setup steps in sequence. That looks correct because each step is properly awaited, ensuring that the next step doesn't start until the previous one finishes.

I check each of the helper functions. They all have async before the function and use await when calling db.query. That means they're correctly written as async functions, which is necessary for using await inside them.

I don't see any callbacks in the provided code. The functions are already using async/await, so there's nothing to convert. The user might have thought that db.query was using callbacks, but in this case, it's using Promises since await is working directly with it.

So, the code is already in the correct format. There's no need to make any changes because it's using async/await appropriately. The user probably didn't realize that their code was already up to date with modern async/await syntax.

I should inform the user that their code doesn't need any changes. It's already using async/await correctly, so the setup will run each step in order, handling errors properly with try/catch.

In summary, the code is fine as is. No conversion is necessary because it's already using async/await effectively.

The code you've provided is already using async/await syntax and doesn't contain any callback-based code. The functions are properly using Promises with `async/await` and there's nothing to convert. The code is already in the correct format for modern async/await usage.

If you have any specific callback-based code you'd like converted, feel free to share it, and I can help you convert it to use async/await.
